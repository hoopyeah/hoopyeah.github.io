- Quantum Computing and Quantum Information, Nielson and Chuang, 10th anniversary edition
- Schumacher book for intro to quantum mechanics
- Mermin is for computer scientists
- Lipton and Regan are new with examples

- Introduction: Classical Bits (cbits) and Quantum Bits (qubits)
- A classical bit has two __states__: 0 and 1 {0,1}
- A classical computation: transformation of a bit string.
- EG: 11001 --> 10101
- 1101 a 5-bit string
- --> a transform, f
- f:{0,1}^5 --> {0,1}^5
- domain --> range
- ^5 is the Cartesian product
- "f maps (zero, one) five times to (zero, one) five times."

- ? Injective functions? Surjective functions?
- How many cbits are there in a bit string?
- 3 cbits
