Title: Sister future
Author: Cody Fernandez

## This summer:
- Learn to Code
- Python -> Jupyter Notebooks

## Classes:
 - Do good
  
## Free Time??:
- Join your professional societies as a student member
    - Probably something like American Chemists Society or something
- Join whatever your "women in STEM" organization is
    - for engineering it's SWE - the Society of Women Engineers
- This weird volunter programmer for the [DoD thing](https://www.nsin.us/tech-squad/)

## Research:
- Start in a professor’s lab, perhaps unpaid but should be paid for summers

## Start-up stuff:
- There's a lot of money and opportunity pouring into the "Innovation/Start-up" space. If clubs sound boring, this is a good way to pump up your "involvement" while actually trying to make money or do something interesting

## Summers:
- Research labs or companies
- Federal Gov’t research labs
    - Oak Ridge
	- Lawrence Livermore
	- Lawrence Berkeley
- Army Research Lab
- Office of Naval Research
- Air Force Office of Scientific Research
- Corporate
    - DuPont
	- Johnson & Johnson
	- Pfizer etc.
	- Brother

## Internships/Co-ops
- I think this is a really good idea. Take 5 years to graduate because you did a co-op for a year. Who cares?
- At GT, a co-op is a formal program where you commit yourself to a company for 3 full-time semesters (and usually a summer in between). Expectations are appropriate and the company really invests in you (hoping you'll enjoy yourself and stick around).

## First Job:
- Rotational Program?
    - Travel around country 6 months at a time
    - Only example I have on hand is BNSF Railroad

## Grad School:
- Need to think about getting a Master’s to stay relevant and to specialize
